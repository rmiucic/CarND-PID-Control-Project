# CarND-Controls-PID

### Discussion
My code compiles and runs well. I have used Netbeans IDE. 
I have implemented two controllers: for speed and steering control. For stering control I am using Cross Track Error (CTE). CTE is a lateral distance between vehicle position and center of the lane. For speed controller I am the differnce in speed from a set speed (variable I added and set to 40MPH) and actual vehicle speed (a value coming from the simulator). I have introduced controler sequentially. 
1) First, I left throtle value at 0.3  and implemented PID controlled for steering control 
```C++
msgJson["throttle"] = 0.3;
``` 
I have manually tuned stering controller. The values were
 
```C++
Kp=0.1; Ki=0.0001, Kd=1.0; //for initial steering PID
``` 
these values ensured that the car was able to travel the path without going off the track.
2) I added speed PID controller and manually tuned parameters.
```C++
Kp=1; Ki=0.0, Kd=0.001; //for speed PID
``` 
now the speed was always around 39.6MPH (slightly bellow set speed) which was good enough for me and I did not tune the speed PID controlled further.
3) I have implmented a twiddle algorithm mainly from the udacity lecture notes and some other references I found online. 
```C++
stabilize_steps = 100;
twidle_step_cnt = 1500;
``` 
Twiddle algorithm was executed every 1600 time steps. Given the speed the car was driving, 1600 time steps ensured that the vehicle travelled 1 full loop (it would heve been nice if the simulation provided x,y positions so that I did not have to guess how many time steps needed to complete the loop). For a given loop, the only after stabilization period, 100 time steps, error was counted in  total error. 
After 50 loops, Final PID coefficient values for steering PID came to be:
```C++
Kp=0.209078; Ki=0.000137587, Kd=1.61051; //for speed PID
``` 
For the final confirmation please see the screen capture video simulation_run.mp4 within this repository.

* Simulator. You can download these from the [project intro page](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases) in the classroom.

Fellow students have put together a guide to Windows set-up for the project [here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-selfdrivingcar/files/Kidnapped_Vehicle_Windows_Setup.pdf) if the environment you have set up for the Sensor Fusion projects does not work for this project. There's also an experimental patch for windows in this [PR](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-PID-Control-Project/pull/3).

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./pid`. 

Tips for setting up your environment can be found [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/23d376c7-0195-4276-bdf0-e02f1f3c665d)

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!

More information is only accessible by people who are already enrolled in Term 2
of CarND. If you are enrolled, see [the project page](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/f1820894-8322-4bb3-81aa-b26b3c6dcbaf/lessons/e8235395-22dd-4b87-88e0-d108c5e5bbf4/concepts/6a4d8d42-6a04-4aa6-b284-1697c0fd6562)
for instructions and the project rubric.

## Hints!

* You don't have to follow this directory structure, but if you do, your work
  will span all of the .cpp files here. Keep an eye out for TODOs.

## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to we ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
